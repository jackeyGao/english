       4、The forecast mainly tells us the whole country will have fine weather tomorrow.

       5、You can infer from the passage that none of the places offers ideal weather tomorrow for travel.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> There was once an ant that was very thirsty.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> It ran here and there looking for some water but could not find any. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Then suddenly, when the ant was almost ready to die of thirst, a large drop of water fell on it. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The ant drank the water, which saved its life. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The water was actually a tear from a young girl who was crying. Because of her sadness, the tear had magical qualities and suddenly the ant could speak the language of human beings. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The ant looked up and saw the young girl sitting in front of a huge pile of seeds. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "Why are you sad?" asked the ant. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "I'm the prisoner of a giant." the girl told the ant. "He won't let me go until I've made three separate heaps of grain, barley（大麦）and rye（黑麦）out of this huge pile of seeds in which they are all mixed together." </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "That will take you a month!" the ant said, looking at the huge pile of seeds. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "I know," the girl cried, "and if I haven't finished by tomorrow, the giant will eat me for his supper!" </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "Don't cry," the ant said, "my friends and I will help you." </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Soon thousands of ants were at work, separating the three kinds of seeds. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The next morning, when the giant saw that the work had been done, he let the girl go. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Thus it was one of her tears that saved her life. </p>

      
      
       1、The ant was playing when it ran here and there.

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The ant drank the water, which saved its life. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The water was actually a tear from a young girl who was crying. Because of her sadness, the tear had magical qualities and suddenly the ant could speak the language of human beings. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The ant looked up and saw the young girl sitting in front of a huge pile of seeds. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "Why are you sad?" asked the ant. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "I'm the prisoner of a giant." the girl told the ant. "He won't let me go until I've made three separate heaps of grain, barley（大麦）and rye（黑麦）out of this huge pile of seeds in which they are all mixed together." </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "That will take you a month!" the ant said, looking at the huge pile of seeds. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "I know," the girl cried, "and if I haven't finished by tomorrow, the giant will eat me for his supper!" </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> "Don't cry," the ant said, "my friends and I will help you." </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Soon thousands of ants were at work, separating the three kinds of seeds. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The next morning, when the giant saw that the work had been done, he let the girl go. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Thus it was one of her tears that saved her life. </p>

      
      
       5、The ant's friends saved the girl's life.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The climate of any place is the kind of weather it usually has over a long period of time. The kind of homes we live in, the clothes we wear even, the food we eat depend on the climate of the place where we live. Climate is complicated; it is affected by many things. If you live near one of the poles, you live in a cold climate, for you do not get much direct sunshine as you would get farther from the poles. If you live near the equator(赤道), you live in a warm or very hot climate, for this is the region where the sun shines almost straight down.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> How much rain or snow falls makes a great difference to the climate. You may live in a hot, dry land, where little rain falls. This will be a desert. Its climate is quite different from that of a rain forest, where rain falls almost every day. The amount of rain or snow in a cold land depends upon the winds, upon the nearby mountains, and upon the currents in nearby seas. Rainfall depends on many different things. </p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> No one is glad to hear that his body has to be cut open by a surgeon（外科医生） and part of it taken out. Today, however, we needn't worry about feeling of pain during the operation. The sick person falls into a kind of sleep, and when he awakes, the operation is finished. But these happy conditions are fairly new. It is not many years since a man who had to have an operation felt all his pain.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Long ago, operation had usually to be done while the sick man could feel everything. The sick man had to be held down on a table by force while the doctors did their best for him. He could feel all the pain if his leg or arm was being cut off, and his fearful cries filled the room and the hearts of those who watched. </p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Soon after 1770, Joseph Priestley discovered a gas which is now called "laughing gas". Laughing gas became known in America. Young men and women went to parties to try it. Most of them spent their time laughing, but one man at a party, Horace Wells, noticed that people didn't seem to feel pain when they were using this gas. He decided to make an experiment on himself. He asked a friend to help him. </p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Wells took some of the gas, and his friend pulled out one of Well's teeth. Wells felt no pain at all. </p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> As he didn't know enough about laughing gas, he gave a man less gas than he should have. The man cried out with pain when his tooth was being pulled out. </p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Wells tried again, but this time he gave too much of the gas, and the man died. Wells never forgot this terrible event. </p>
      
      
       4、If a man took less laughing gas than he should have when an operation went on, he still felt pain.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The French Revolution broke out in 1789. At the time France was in a crisis. The government was badly run and people’s lives were miserable. King Louis XIV tried to control the national parliament and raise more taxes. But his effort failed. He ordered his troops to Versailles. The people thought that Louis intended to put down the Revolution by force. On July 14,1789, they stormed and took the Bastille, where political prisoners were kept. Ever since that day, July 14 has been the French National Day. Louis tried to flee the country in 1792 to get support from Austria and Prussia. However, he was caught and put in prison. In September 1792, the monarchy was abolished. In the same year, Louis was executed. A few months later his wife, Marie also had her head cut off. The Revolution of France had frightened the other kings of Europe. Armies from Austria and Prussia began to march against France. The French raised republican armies to defend the nation.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The French Revolution broke out in 1789. At the time France was in a crisis. The government was badly run and people’s lives were miserable. King Louis XIV tried to control the national parliament and raise more taxes. But his effort failed. He ordered his troops to Versailles. The people thought that Louis intended to put down the Revolution by force. On July 14,1789, they stormed and took the Bastille, where political prisoners were kept. Ever since that day, July 14 has been the French National Day. Louis tried to flee the country in 1792 to get support from Austria and Prussia. However, he was caught and put in prison. In September 1792, the monarchy was abolished. In the same year, Louis was executed. A few months later his wife, Marie also had her head cut off. The Revolution of France had frightened the other kings of Europe. Armies from Austria and Prussia began to march against France. The French raised republican armies to defend the nation. The Revolution went through a period of terror. Thousands of people lost their lives. In the end, power passed to Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> A foreigner’s first impression of the U.S. is likely to be that everyone is in a rush-often under pressure.

Racing through daytime meals is part of the pace of life in this country.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Working time is considered precious.

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> You also find drivers will be abrupt and that people will push past you. You will miss smiles, brief conversations, and small courtesies with strangers.

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The view of time affects the importance we attach to patience. In the American system of values, patience is not a high priority. Many of us have what might be called “a short fuse.” We begin to move restlessly about if we feel time is slipping away without some returnbe this in terms of pleasure, work value, or rest. Those coming from lands where time is looked upon differently may find this matter of pace to be one of their most difficult adjustments in both business and daily life.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Many newcomers to the States will miss the opening courtesy of a business call, for example, they will miss the ritual socializing that goes with a welcoming cup of tea or coffee they may be traditional in their own country.

We seek out evidence of past performance rather than evaluate a business colleague through social courtesies. Since we generally assess and probe professionally rather than socially, we start talking business very quickly.</p>

      
      
       1、The statement that Americans are impolite to their business colleagues is wrong.

       2、In the fourth paragraph, “a high priority" means a “first concern".

        <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Three men traveling on a train began a conversation about the world's greatest wonders.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> “In my opinion,” the first man said, “the Egyptian pyramids（埃及金字塔）are the world's greatest wonder. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Although they were built thousands of years ago, they are still standing. And remember: the people who built them had only simple tools. They did not have the kind of machinery that builders and engineers have today.” </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> “I agree that the pyramids in Egypt are wonderful,” the second man said, “but I do not think they are the  greatest wonder. I believe computers are more wonderful than the pyramids. They have taken people to the moon and  brought them back safely. In seconds，they carry out mathematical calculations that would take a person a hundred years to do.” </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> He turned to the third man and asked, “What do you think is the greatest wonder in the world？” </p> And he took a thermos out of his bag and held it up. The other two men were very surprised. “A thermos?” they exclaimed. “But that's a simple thing.” </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> “Oh, no，it's not, ”the third man said. “In the winter you put in a hot drink and it stays hot. In the summer you put in a cold drink and it stays cold. How does the thermos know whether it's winter or summer？” </p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Today the official language of the United Sates and most of Canada is English. However, French almost became the official language because of a war.</p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The French and Indian War was fought between 1754 and 1763. The name of this war is not accurate because the war was actually between England and France. The Indian fought on the side of the French. </p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> France and England were trying to gain control of North America. France held Canada, and England held part of what is now the United States. However, France tried to expand its land by moving southward into New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia. When the French built a fort on the Ohio River, the residents in Virginia sent George Washington to attack the fort in 1754. However, the French defeated Washington. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The French, aided by Indians, outsmarted（更精明） the English and won many early battles. Later, the British began to do well against the French. In the final battle in Quebec, Canada, General Wolfe of England faced General Montcalm from France. Both general died in this battle, but the English outlasted（比……持久）the French and won the battle. Thus, most of North America today has the English culture and language. </p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Today the official language of the United Sates and most of Canada is English. However, French almost became the official language because of a war.</p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> In 1933 an unknown American called Clarence Nash went to see the filmmaker Walt Disney. He had an unusual voice and he wanted to work in Disney's cartoon（动画片） film for children. When Walt Disney heard Nash's voice, he said,"Stop! That's our duck!"</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The duck was the now-famous Donald Duck, who first appeared in 1934 in the film The Wise Little Hen. Donald lived in an old houseboat and wore his sailor jacket and hat.

And they loved his voice when he became angry with Mickey's eight nephews. Soon Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse himself, probably because he wasn't a goody-goody like Mickey. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> In the 1930s, 40s and 50s Donald and his friends Mickey, Goofy and Pluto made hundreds of Disney cartoons.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Modern life is impossible without traveling. The fastest way of traveling is by plane. with a modern airliner you can travel in one day places which it took a month or more to get to a hundred years ago.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Traveling by train is slower than by plane, but is has its advantages. you can see the country you are traveling through. modern trains have comfortable seats and dining-cars. They make even the longest journey enjoyable.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Some people prefer to travel by sea when possible. there are large liners and river boats. you can visit many other countries and different parts of your country on them. ships are not so fast as trains or planes but traveling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Many people like to travel by car. you can make your own timetable. you can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty or one hundred miles a day, just as you like, you can stop where ever you wish -where there is something interesting to see, at good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or at a hotel to spend the night. that is why traveling by car is popular for pleasure trips, while people usually take a train or plane when they are traveling on business.</p>
      
      
       5、Four ways of traveling are mentioned in the passage.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Mark was walking home from school one day when he noticed a boy ahead of him. He had tripped(绊倒) and dropped all of the books he was carrying, along with some clothes, a baseball bat and a glove.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Mark knelt down and helped the boy pick up the things. Since they were going the same way, he offered to carry some things for the boy.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>As they walked, Mark discovered the boy’s name was Bill. He loved video games, baseball and history, but he was having trouble with some of his subjects.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>They arrived at Bill’s home first. Mark was invited in for a Coke and to watch some television. The afternoon passed pleasantly with some laughs and talk. Then Mark went home.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>They continued to see each other around school, had lunch together once or twice, then both graduated from junior school.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Three days before graduation, Bill asked Mark if they could talk.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Bill reminded Mark of the day years ago when they had first met. “Did you ever wonder why I was carrying so many things home that day?” asked Bill.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>“You see, I took away all my things from school. I had stored away some of my mother’s sleeping pills(安眠药). I was going home to kill myself. But after we spent some time talking and laughing, I realized that if I had died, I would have missed so many good times. So you see, Mark, when you picked up those books that day, you did a lot more. You saved my life.”</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Mr Perkin parked his car in a big car-park near his office, and walked the rest of the way. But when he came back at five o'clock, there were so many bright yellow Beta 400s in the car-park that he did not know which car was his.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Mr Perkin stood at the bus-stop and watched the cars go by. Many of the cars were new Beta 400s, and most of them were yellow. Mr Perkin always wore the same clothes as other men, ate the same food as other people, and did the same things after work, and at the end of the week, Mr Perkin did not like to be different.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>The following week, Mr Perkin bought a new, bright yellow Beta 400s. He was satisfied with it, and drove to work in it the very next day. He was even more satisfied with his new car, when he saw all the other Beta 400s, in front, behind, and on both sides of him.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Mr Perkin parked his car in a big car-park near his office, and walked the rest of the way. But when he came back at five o'clock, there were so many bright yellow Beta 400s in the car-park that he did not know which car was his. He tried his key in some of the cars, but people passing by gave him a look he didn't like. So he stopped.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Poor Mr Perkin had to wait nearly two hours until his was the only yellow Beta 400s in the car-park.</p>
      
      
       4、People gave him a look because he had a nice new car.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Nowadays, any Chinese can enjoy the luxury (奢侈) of owning a private car, if he or she has enough money to buy it. Having a car of your own means no more traveling on crowded buses or subway trains, and you can drop off the children at school on the way. What's more, it also means that you can enjoy the weekends and holidays better, because with a car you can go to places where the regular buses and trains do not go to.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>However, besides the advantages of owning a car, there are also disadvantages of owning a car. On one hand, with the increasing number of the private cars, the roads are becoming more and more crowded, and it often makes the journey hard and more and more traffic accidents happen. On the other hand, we know the prices of gasoline and repairs are constantly rising, so it is very expensive to run a car. You have to pay more for a license and insurance.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of owning a car, we can make a conclusion that the advantages of owning a car outweigh (超过) the disadvantages. Therefore, it seems that China should increase its output of cars and make the private car market larger. The result would be that cars would become cheaper and cheaper.</p>
      
      
       1、Private cars can take you to places where the regular buses do not go.

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Just then Paul's telephone rang. He put down his notebook and picked up the telephone.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>"Good morning," Jack's voice said, "You must be wrong about that test."</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>"What do you mean?" Paul asked weakly.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>"We're not going to have the test today." Jack said. "I wrote down the date in my notebook. The test will be next Wednesday; it isn't today. How do you feel this morning?"</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>"Fine," said Paul. "Just fine!" Suddenly he really felt fine.</p>
      
      
       4、“How do you feel this morning?” From this question we can see Jack knew Paul very well.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'>In learning a foreign language, one should first pay attention to speaking. It is the ground-work（基础）of reading and writing. You'd better try your best to speak. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. While you are doing this, a good exercise is to write --- keep a diary, write notes or letters and so on.

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>If you are slow in speaking, don't worry. One of the helpful ways is to improve your English by reading, either aloud or low to yourself.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Education in the United States is usually divided into four levels. These are early children, elementary, secondary and higher education. School attendance is required in every state of the country, and in most states students must attend school from the age of 6 to 16.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>The first level is early childhood education. Its main purpose is to prepare children for school.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>The second level is elementary education. Education at this level is divided into six or eight grades, and children learn reading, arithmetic, writing, social studies and science. They also have art, music and physical education.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>The third level is secondary education. It is for junior and senior high school students. Some students take courses to prepare themselves for college. Other students take technical or vocational courses that prepare them for jobs after they graduate from high school.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Higher education continues after high school. There are many kinds of institutions of higher education. Technical institutes offer two-year programs in electronics, engineering, business and other subjects. After two years at a junior college, students receive an associate degree and then they can continue at a four-year college.</p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'>When my husband was promoted, we put our house up for sale. Three weeks later, it was still on the market. I became a busy house keeper. Every room had to be kept tidy and dishes had to be washed and put away when used.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Then one day the doorbell rang unexpectedly at 8 a.m., sleepily I opened the door and saw our agent standing there with a couple from New York. "There was no time to call," he explained, "the couple had to catch a plane home."</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>The three people made their way past the dirty breakfast dishes on the kitchen table and into a bedroom with unmade bed. As I retreated（退却） into a bathroom to comb my hair, I heard the man say something to his wife. Then they both laughed.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Two days later, the agent phoned to tell me that the couple had bought the house. He repeated what the buyer had said when he handed over the check the following day, "That house has a warm, lived-in feeling, just like ours."</p>
