          <p><p style='text-indent: 2em;'> As we all know, not all people can make success in their lives. Most people will meet with failures on the way to success. Why do some people get successful in their lives? I think there are three reasons. Firstly, they have strong willpower. Once they decide to do something, they will never give up. Secondly, they work hard. Once they set up a goal, they will work hard to achieve it. Thirdly, they never easily quit. They always stick to their aims. </p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> I believe that where there is a will there is a way, and that success belongs to those who can make constant efforts. </p></p>

          <p><p style='text-indent: 2em;'> When you are reading something in English, you may often come across a new word. What's the best way to know it? We should choose a good English-Chinese dictionary. It tells us the meaning of the English words in Chinese. When you meet a new word, don't use the dictionary at once. Try your best to think about what it means before you look it up in the dictionary. If you can't guess the meaning, look it up in the dictionary. If you use the dictionary as often as possible in your English learning, it will become your good friend. </p></p>
