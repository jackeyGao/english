       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Sixteen-year-old Maria was waiting in line at the airport in Santo Domingo. She was leaving her native country to join her sister in the United States. She spoke English very well. Though she was very happy she could go abroad, she was feeling sad at leaving her family and fiends. As she was thinking all about this, she suddenly heard the airline employee asking her to pick up her luggage and put it on the scales（称）. Maria pulled and pulled. The bag was too heavy and she just couldn’t lift it up. The man behind her got very impatient. He, too, was waiting to check in his luggage.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> “What’s wrong with this girl?” He said, “Why doesn’t she hurry up?” He moved forward and placed his bag on the counter, hoping to check in fist. He was in a hurry to get a good seat.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Maria was very angry, but she was very polite. And in her best English she said, “Why are you so upset? There are enough seats for everyone on the plane. If you are in such a hurry, why can’t you give me a hand with my luggage?”</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The man was surprised to hear Maria speak English. He quickly picked up her luggage and stepped back. Everyone was looking at him with disapproval. (224 words)</p>

She was leaving her native country to join her sister in the United States.”（16岁的玛丽亚正在圣多明戈机场排队等候。她将离开自己的祖国去找在美国的姐姐）。因此我们确定选择答案D。选项B里短语on one’s way back to意为“在返回某地的路上”。</p>

          <p>这是一道推断题，本题询问故事中的机场工作人员的工作是什么。与寻找细节题的答案一样，我们需要查找信息所对应的句子或者句群。通过浏览文章，我们发现本题对应的是第一段的一句话“….., she suddenly heard the airline employee asking her to pick up her luggage and put it on the scales（称）.”（她突然听到机场工作人员让她把行李放在称上称重）。因此，我们可以推断出这个工作的职责就是检查行李并负责托运。此外，根据常识，我们也知道在办理登机手续时，我们需要将一些行李托运。因此我们确定选择答案C。注意这里选项B很容易被误以为是正确答案，需要留心分析，要求乘客将行李拿起来不是这个工作人员的主要职责。</p>

          <p>这是一道细节题，本题询问“伊拉克战争究竟对英法两国的关系产生了什么样的影响？”。本题的关键词是the war in Iraq，我们通过浏览全文，可以将这个信息定位在第三段里，这一段先讲到英法两国因对伊拉克战争所持不同的观点，所以两国的关系受到了一些影响，但该段的最后一句话“However, some political experts say the war in Iraq could in fact have helped ties.”（但是很多专家认为伊拉克战争事实上又促进了两国的关系）。转折连词however的出现表示伊拉克战争对两国的关系是有利有弊，因此我们确定选择答案D。这里还需注意文章中用了ties来代替relationship。这也是英语文章的一个特点，用近义词或同义词来代替关键词，以避免重复。</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> I’m sure you’ll enjoy this community service … and you’ll gain valuable experience at the same time.

We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. A new community program called “One On One” helps elementary students who’ve fallen behind. Your education majors might be especially interested in it because it offers the opportunity to do some teaching, that is, tutoring in math and English.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> You’d have to volunteer two hours a week for one semester. You can choose to help a child with math, English, or both. Half-hour lessons are fine, so you could do a half hour of each subject two days a week.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Professor Dodge will act as a mentor to the tutors — he’ll be available to help you with lesson plans or to offer suggestions for activities. He has office hours every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. You can sign up for the program with him and begin the tutoring next week.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> I’m sure you’ll enjoy this community service … and you’ll gain valuable experience at the same time. It looks good on your resume, too, showing that you’ve had experience with children and that you care about your community. If you’d like to sign up, or if you have any questions, stop by Professor Dodge’s office this week. (220 words)</p>

If it is displayed on such occasions, do not allow the flag to fall to the ground, but let it be carried high up in the air to form a feature of the ceremony.我们浏览四个答案后，发现答案里be carried high up in the air刚巧出现在这一组句子的最后部分，所以我们确定答案为D。</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one’s own.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Then, in the country one can really get away from the noise and hurry of busy working lives. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one’s free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has got the reward together with those who have shared the secret of Nature.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight’s (two weeks) visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want: the rest they are quite prepared to leave to those who are glad to get away from London every night.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Hostels</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Cheap, good-value hostels are aimed at all types of like-minded travelers, who prefer value over luxury and you don’t have to be young or single to use them. Britain’s independent hostels and backpackers hostels also offer a great welcome. Facilities and prices vary, especially in rural areas, where some hostels are a little more than a bunkhouse（临时住房）while others are remarkably comfortable — almost like bargain hotels.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Youth Hotels</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Founded many years ago to “help all, especially young people of limited means, to a greater knowledge, love and care of the countryside”, the Youth Hotels Association is still going strong in the 21st century.

In essence you get a room in somebody’s house, and small B&Bs may only have one guest room, so you’ll really feel like part of the family. Larger B&Bs may have four or five rooms and more facilities, but just as warm as a welcome.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> In country areas your B&Bs might be in a village or an isolated farm surrounded by fields. Prices reflect facilities: and usually run from around ￡12 to ￡ 20 per person. City B&Bs charge about ￡25 to ￡ 30 per person, although they’re often cheaper as you go further out to the suburbs.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> As well as selling drinks and meals, Britain’s pubs and inns sometimes offer B&Bs, particularly in country areas. Staying a night or two can be great fun and puts you at the heart of local community.</p>

          <p>C</p>
          <p>这是一道细节题。本题询问“如果你乐于和朋友一起旅行，但却资金有限，应该选择哪种住所？”。在第一分段“Hostels”中，第一句话“Cheap, good-value hostels are aimed at all types of like-minded travelers...”表明“Hostels”不仅经济实惠而且为志趣相投的旅游者提供，因此答案应该选择C。</p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Places to stay in Britain are as varied as the places you visit. Whatever your budget is the choice — from basic barn to small hotel, from tiny cottage to grand castle — is all part of fun.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Hostels</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Cheap, good-value hostels are aimed at all types of like-minded travelers, who prefer value over luxury and you don’t have to be young or single to use them. Britain’s independent hostels and backpackers hostels also offer a great welcome. Facilities and prices vary, especially in rural areas, where some hostels are a little more than a bunkhouse（临时住房）while others are remarkably comfortable — almost like bargain hotels.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Youth Hotels</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Founded many years ago to “help all, especially young people of limited means, to a greater knowledge, love and care of the countryside”, the Youth Hotels Association is still going strong in the 21st century. The network of 230 hotels is a perfect gateway for exploring Britain’s towns and countryside.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> B&Bs</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The B&Bs (bed and breakfasts) is a great British institution. In essence you get a room in somebody’s house, and small B&Bs may only have one guest room, so you’ll really feel like part of the family. Larger B&Bs may have four or five rooms and more facilities, but just as warm as a welcome.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> In country areas your B&Bs might be in a village or an isolated farm surrounded by fields. Prices reflect facilities: and usually run from around ￡12 to ￡ 20 per person. City B&Bs charge about ￡25 to ￡ 30 per person, although they’re often cheaper as you go further out to the suburbs.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> As well as selling drinks and meals, Britain’s pubs and inns sometimes offer B&Bs, particularly in country areas. Staying a night or two can be great fun and puts you at the heart of local community.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Rates range from around ￡15 to ￡ 25 per person. Pubs are more likely to have single rooms.</p>
      
      
       5、Which of the following is NOT true according to the last part of the passage?
      

      
        
          
            <div>A     Pubs and inns usually provide visitors bed and breakfast</div>
          
        
          
            <div>B     All pubs and inns offer visitors bed and breakfast</div>
          
        
          
            <div>C     Pubs and inns charge a visitor ￡ 25 at the most</div>
          
        
          
            <div>D     If you want a single room, you are more likely to get one in pubs</div>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> What makes a person a scientist? Does he have ways or tools of learning that are different from those of others? The answer is “no”. It is not the tools a scientist uses but how he uses these tools that make him a scientist. You will probably agree that knowing how to use a power is important to a carpenter. You will probably agree, too, that knowing how to investigate, how to discover information, is important to everyone. The scientist, however, goes one step further, he must be sure that he has a reasonable answer to his questions and that his answer can be confirmed by other persons. He also works to fit the answer he gets to many questions into a large set of ideas about how the world works.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The scientist’s knowledge must be exact. There is no room for half right or right just half the time. He must be as nearly right as the conditions permit. What works under one set of conditions at one time must work under the same conditions at other times. If the conditions are different, any changes the scientist observes in a demonstration must be explained by the changes in the conditions. This is one reason that investigations are important in science. Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of relativity, arrived at this theory through mathematics. The accuracy of this mathematics was later tested through investigations, Einstein’s ideas were shown to be correct. A scientist uses many tools for measurements. Then the measurements are used to make mathematical calculations that may test his investigations.</p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 p.m. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it’s a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance. In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. A person who is 5 minutes late, will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence. (260 words)</p>

If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 p.m. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it’s a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance. In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. A person who is 5 minutes late, will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence. (260 words)</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Short-term goals are those that usually deal with current activities, which we can apply on a daily basis.

It should be remembered that just as a building is no stronger than its foundation, long-term goals cannot amount to very much without the achievement of solid short-term goals.

They might deal with just one term of school or the entire school year, or they could even extend for several years.

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> There are three kinds of goals: short-term, medium-range and long-term goals.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Short-term goals are those that usually deal with current activities, which we can apply on a daily basis. Such goals can be achieved in a week or less, or two weeks, or possibly, months. It should be remembered that just as a building is no stronger than its foundation, long-term goals cannot amount to very much without the achievement of solid short-term goals. Upon completing our short-term goals, we should date the occasion and then add new short-term goals that will build on those that have been completed.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The intermediate goals build on the foundation of the short-term goals. They might deal with just one term of school or the entire school year, or they could even extend for several years. Any time you move a step at a time, you should never allow yourself to become discouraged or overwhelmed. As you complete each step, you will enforce the belief in your ability to grow and succeed. And as your list of completion dates grow, your motivation and desire will increase.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Long-term goals may be related to our dreams of the future. They might cover five years or more. Life is not a static thing. We should never allow a long-term goal to limit us or our course of action.(221 words)</p>
      
      
       5、Which of the following statements is wrong according to the passage?
      

      
        
          
            <div>A     The long-term goals cannot amount to very much without the achievement of solid short-term goals</div>
          
        
          
            <div>B     The intermediate goals build on the foundation of the short-term goals</div>
          
        
          
            <div>C     Life is a static thing, thus we should never allow a long-term goal to limit us or our course of action</div>
          
        
          
            <div>D     We should often add new short-term goals to those which have been completed</div>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Shyness is the cause of much unhappiness for a great many people. Shy people are anxious and self-conscious; that is, they are excessively concerned with their own appearance and actions. Worrisome thoughts are constantly occurring in their minds: what kind of impression am I making? Do they like me? Do I sound stupid? Am I wearing unattractive clothes?</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> It is obvious that such uncomfortable feelings must negatively affect people. A person’s conception of himself or herself is reflected in the way he or she behaves, and the way a person behaves affects other people’s reactions. In general, the way people think about themselves has a profound effect on all areas of their lives.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Shy people, having low self-esteem, are likely to be passive and easily influenced by others. They need reassurance that they are doing “the right thing.” Shy people are very sensitive to criticism; they feel it confirms their feelings of inferiority. They also find it difficult to be pleased by compliment with a statement like this one, “You’re just saying that to make me feel good. I know it’s not true.” It is clear that while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Can shyness be completely eliminated, or at least reduced? Fortunately, people can overcome shyness with determined and patient efforts in building self-confidence. Since shyness goes hand in hand with a lack of self-esteems, it is important for people to accept their weakness as well as their strengths.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Each one of us is a unique, worthwhile individual, interested in our own personal ways. The better we understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to live up to our full potential. Let’s not allow shyness to block our chances for a rich and fulfilling life.</p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Shyness is the cause of much unhappiness for a great many people. Shy people are anxious and self-conscious; that is, they are excessively concerned with their own appearance and actions. Worrisome thoughts are constantly occurring in their minds: what kind of impression am I making? Do they like me? Do I sound stupid? Am I wearing unattractive clothes?</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> It is obvious that such uncomfortable feelings must negatively affect people. A person’s conception of himself or herself is reflected in the way he or she behaves, and the way a person behaves affects other people’s reactions. In general, the way people think about themselves has a profound effect on all areas of their lives.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Shy people, having low self-esteem, are likely to be passive and easily influenced by others. They need reassurance that they are doing “the right thing.” Shy people are very sensitive to criticism; they feel it confirms their feelings of inferiority. They also find it difficult to be pleased by compliment with a statement like this one, “You’re just saying that to make me feel good. I know it’s not true.” It is clear that while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Can shyness be completely eliminated, or at least reduced? Fortunately, people can overcome shyness with determined and patient efforts in building self-confidence. Since shyness goes hand in hand with a lack of self-esteems, it is important for people to accept their weakness as well as their strengths.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Each one of us is a unique, worthwhile individual, interested in our own personal ways. The better we understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to live up to our full potential. Let’s not allow shyness to block our chances for a rich and fulfilling life.</p>

They had planned either to live in a furnished apartment or to buy used furniture. But they soon learned about a new system that more and more people are using. The renting of home furnishings (bed, tables, dishes, and so on) has become one of America’s fastest growing businesses.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> What kinds of people rent their home furnishings instead of buying them? People who are international business or government officials, foreign students, airline workers, young married couple – people whose job or business may force them to move frequently from one city to another. They save a lot of trouble and the cost of moving their furniture each time. They simply rent new furniture when they reach their new homes. Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture that they really like. Meanwhile, they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> One family, who now have a large, beautiful home of their own, liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things. But usually people don’t like to tell others about it. The idea of renting home furnishings is still quite new, and they are not sure what their neighbors might think. (248words)</p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> A characteristic of American culture that has become almost a tradition is to respect the self-made man — the man who has risen to the top through his own efforts, usually beginning by working with his hands. While the leader in business or industry or the college professor occupies a higher social position and commands greater respect in the community than the common laborer or even the skilled factory worker, he may take pains to point out that his father started life in America as a farmer or laborer of some sort.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> This attitude toward manual（体力的）labor is now still seen many aspects of American life. One is invited to dinner at a home that is not only comfortably but even luxuriously（豪华地）furnished and in which there is every evidence of the fact the family has been able to afford foreign travel, expensive hobbies, and college education for the children; yet the hostess probably will cook the dinner herself, will serve it herself and will wash dishes afterward, furthermore the dinner will not consist merely of something quickly and easily assembled from contents of various cans and a cake or a pie bought at the nearby bakery. On the contrary, the hostess usually takes pride in careful preparation of special dishes. A professional may talk about washing the car, digging in his flowerbeds, painting the house. His wife may even help with these things, just as he often helps her with the dishwashing. The son who is away at college may wait on table and wash dishes for his living, or during the summer he may work with a construction gang on a highway in order to pay for his education.</p>

When he looked around, he saw several old people put glasses on before reading their newspapers, so after lunch he decided to go to a shop to buy himself some glasses too. He walked along the road, and soon found a shop. </p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The man in the shop made him try on a lot of glasses, but Tom always said. “No, I can't read with these.” </p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The man became more and more puzzled （迷惑不解）, until finally he said. “Excuse me. but can you read at all?” </p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> “No. of course I can't!” Tom said angrily. “If I was already able to read, do you think I would have come here to buy glasses?” </p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Morgan Rees has always been a good businessman. He used to own three petrol stations and was busy most of the time. When he was 65, the normal retirement age, he decided that he didn't want to stop, so he carried on working for another two years. Eventually, when he was nearly 68, his wife, Dolly, asked him to retire because she wanted to enjoy their old age together. Reluctantly, he handed over the business to his son.</p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> But he was unhappy. He didn't know what to do with himself. Although he read a lot of books and he went on holiday to interesting places with his wife, he was bored and began to get depressed because he hated being retired.</p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> Then one day he saw an advertisement in the newspaper and, without telling his wife, he bought a small crockery (陶器) factory. The next week he told his family. They were horrified and worried. They thought he was too old at 71 to start work again.</p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> He is now 76 and he has expanded the company considerably. He has increased the number of staff from 6 to 24 and he has found many new customers for the products. He has developed the export market and has improved profits by 200%. He has opened a new design office and employed three young designers. They have been all over the world to get new ideas, and one of them has gone to France this week to a major trade fair. Most importantly, he hasn't been bored since he bought the factory.</p>

       <p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The residents of 24 Acacia Grove were dissatisfied with the condition of the property, so John Preston called a meeting to discuss things last week. At the meeting John suggested setting up a residents’ committee. Everyone was so worried and angry about the agent’s inactivity that they agreed, and they elected John as chairman of the committee. Many residents said that they were tired of telephoning the agent and tired of complaining about the flats. Although the agent was responsible for the flats, they thought that he didn’t do enough. Therefore John was asked to write to the agent and say that they were disappointed with the management of the flats. </p> 

<p style='text-indent: 2em;'> The next service payment was due at the end of the month. However, they agreed not to pay it until they were happy with the plans to improve the property.

          <p>D</p>
          <p>这是一道词义推测题，我们通常需要根据上下文的线索来猜测词义。就本题而言，划线词所在句子的大意是“1792年9月，君主制被怎么样了。”这篇文章是按照时间顺序进行叙述的，所以我们需要了解在1792年9月之前发生了什么，我们细读这几句话“Louis tried to flee the country in 1792, to get the support from Austria and Prussia. However, he was caught and put in prison. In September 1792, the monarchy was abolished.”（1792年国王路易十四试图逃跑以期得到奥地利和匈牙利的支持，但是他还是被捕入狱）。随后在这句话后面出现句子“In the same year, Louis was executed.”（同年，路易十四被处决）。因此我们可以推断一个国家国王逃跑，后又被处决，那么这个国家的政权制度肯定就被废除了，所以我们确定答案D。这里选项A短语 put off的意思是“推迟、推延”。选项B的意思是“建立、设立”；选项C的意思是“联合，团结”。</p>

          <p>这是一道推断题，本题询问“以下哪个不是法国大革命产生的效果？”。这道推断题不太容易找到具体对应的句子或者句群，需要我们从整篇文章的内容中进行推断。在我们对四个选项进行认真分析后发现，选项A说明法国大革命爆发之日成为法国的国庆日，选项B说明法国大革命对欧洲其他国王带来了影响，选项C说明路易十四的妻子在大革命爆发后也被处死，这些都是讲述法国大革命爆发后的事件，而选项D则是描述大革命爆发前的状态——国王试图控制议会，这并不是法国大革命所带来的影响，所以我们确定选择答案D。</p>

          <p>这是一道词义推测题，我们通常需要根据上下文的线索来猜测词义。就本题而言，划线词所在句子的大意是“在美国人的价值体系里，耐心并不是一个high priority。”在这一句之前，作者提到 “The view of time affects the importance we attach to patience.”（对待时间的观点影响了对待耐心的重要程度）。在这段之前，作者已经提到，美国人生活节奏快，非常珍惜时间，匆忙是美国人的生活写照，因此我们可以推断美国人对待耐心的重视并不是他们价值体系的首要因素，随后作者又提到“Many of us have what might be called “a short fuse.””（很多人都是所谓的急性子）。因此我们可以确定选择答案B。</p>
